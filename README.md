# Climbing Logbook :mount_fuji:
> [View here (on Github Pages)](https://martinbagshaw.github.io/ReactLogbook/)

An SPA (Single Page Application) implementation of my climbing logbook, taken from [UKClimbing.com](https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/showlog.php?id=152526). A new and improved version of a [much more naive version](https://github.com/martinbagshaw/climbing-logbook), which I made in plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to run in development mode. View at [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/)
4. `npm t` to run tests with jest and react testing library
